# Computer-Graphics
Individual Assginments for [UofT CSC317: Computer Graphics](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-csc317). Implemented by C++.

## [Assignment 1: Raster Images](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-raster-images) 
### [Implementation](https://github.com/Zoe0123/computer-graphics-raster-images) 
Image manipulations including reflections, rotations, shifts, mosaicing and demosaicing, rgb/hsv conversions, desaturation, and superimposing. 

## [Assignment 2: Ray Casting](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-ray-casting) 
### [Implementation](https://github.com/Zoe0123/computer-graphics-ray-casting) 
Cast rays into a scene to render shapes including spheres, planes, triangles, and Bunny.

## [Assignment 3: Ray Tracer](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-ray-tracing) 
### [Implementation](https://github.com/Zoe0123/computer-graphics-ray-tracing) 
Ray tracing rendering engine that simulates the interation between the ray, and the objects and light sources. Implemented the Blinn-Phong shading model, shadow, and Mirror Reflection.

## [Assignment 4: Bounding Volume Hierarchy](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-bounding-volume-hierarchy)
### [Implementation](https://github.com/Zoe0123/computer-graphics-bounding-volume-hierarchy)
Implemented an object partitioning scheme (Axis-Aligned Bounding-Box Tree (AABB Tree)) to improve the algorithmic performance of ray tracing.

## [Assignment 5: Meshes](https://github.com/alecjacobson/computer-graphics-meshes) 
### [Implementation]()
Implemented texture mapping from a 3D surface to 2D when the surface is not flat. Performed Catmull-Clark subdivision to increase the resolution.

### Ongoing course and assignments, will publish code and other assginments later
